# Code

You may insert your code into this directory

**The code should include:**

1. Scaper code
2. Server side code to pull data from database
3. Front end code to display the data
4. Include a JSON/CSV file of the data in your database after running your scraper and other code that you may have used.

**The code that goes in this directory will be the raw code. Code that you can view in the editor.**

**Do not submit the builded code here.**

The build code will be uploaded to the server and you will submit the link to your server in the sources/journal.
