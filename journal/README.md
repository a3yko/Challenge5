# Link and Blurb (Journal)

You may insert your link and blurb into this markdown document

Make sure you have:

1. URL to instance
2. The overall idea of what you are crawling and scraping and why that would be a valuable product
3. Detailed steps how to setup your environment and default examples we can test your scraper with
4. Problems you faced and how you solved them with refences. You can also put knowledge gained to help future programmers.
5. If you used something other than Scrapy, you will do a small comparison from the tool/framwork you used versus scrapy
   - What are the pro and cons for each
   - Why did you decided to use the other one
   - Etc.

Make sure your document is easy to read and using correct markdown
